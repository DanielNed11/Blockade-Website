                    <h4>Final Website Version and Deployment</h4>
                    <p><b>Overview:</b> In this final sprint, the website was finalized, polished, and prepared for submission. All planned pages were completed, styles were refined, and interactivity was added. The website now fully represents our project and is accessible online via the GitLab repository.</p>

                    <p><b>Key Updates:</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Added all remaining content and updated existing sections for clarity and completeness.</li>
                        <li>Improved layout and styling across all pages using CSS for a cleaner, responsive design.</li>
                        <li>Tested the website on multiple screen sizes and browsers to ensure compatibility.</li>
                        <li>Included GitLab repository link for easy access to the full codebase and deployed version.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><b>Reason for Changes:</b> These final adjustments were made to ensure a complete, user-friendly, and professional-looking website that clearly communicates our project and its progress throughout all sprints.</p>

                <h3>Data # 6: Wrap up and track changes - Hildo </h3><div class="milestone-section">
                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p>This deliverable summarizes all the changes made after the hand-ins of Sprint 1, Sprint 2, and Sprint 3 for the Data & AI part of our project.
                <h4>Chapter 1: Sprint 1</h4>
                <p>No changes were required for Sprint 1. All initial deliverables such as the database schema, DDL/DML scripts, and data model were complete and functional, so no updates were necessary.</p>

                <h4>Chapter 2: Sprint 2</h4>
                <p>Several updates were made to reflect the implementation of game statistics and leaderboard functionality:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>New SQL functions were added to the database to calculate scores, play time, and move durations.</li>
                    <li>Move data is now stored for each game, enabling detailed statistics per player and per game.</li>
                    <li>The leaderboard was implemented in JavaFX using SQL queries and is updated in real time based on game results.</li>
                    <li>A visual chart (bar chart) was added to display the time taken per move, including outliers.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Chapter 3: Sprint 3</h4>
                <p>We made changes to support our rule-based AI player:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Java classes <code>RuleBasedStrategy</code>, <code>InferenceEngine</code>, and <code>FactHandler</code> were created to implement a simple AI using if-then rules.</li>
                    <li>The AI logic was integrated into the game and can now play against human players with basic decision-making.</li>
                    <li><code>Tile.java</code> was updated to support vertical stacking of pieces, enabling better handling of AI moves.</li>
                </ul>

                    <p>This sprint reminded us that deadlines come and go, but the most important thing is supporting one another and making it to the finish line together. Weâ€™ve grown a lot as individuals, but even more as a team.</p>
