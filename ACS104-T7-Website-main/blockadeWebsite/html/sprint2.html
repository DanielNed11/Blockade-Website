                    <p>Created the main game screen using the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) pattern:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Model:</b> Manages the game logic (e.g., turn order, move validation, score updates).
                        </li>
                        <li><b>View:</b> JavaFX layout that shows the game board, player info, and controls.</li>
                        <li><b>Presenter:</b> Handles user interactions (e.g., pawn movement), updates the model, and
                            refreshes the view.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The screen supports multiple turns between players, updates the board visually after each move,
                        and reflects current game stats. For now, the game plays in a simplified form without special
                        rules or end-game detection.</p>

                        color and preferences).</p>
                    <ul>

                <p><b>üîß Improvements Based on Feedback</b></p>

                <h4>1. Sudoers File Cleanup</h4>
                <p>Based on technical feedback, we identified and removed an unused project_admins.save.1 file with
                    incorrect 440 permissions in /etc/sudoers.d. This cleanup ensures secure sudo access and avoids
                    potential conflicts.</p>

                <h4>2. PostgreSQL Connection Logging</h4>
                <p>We reconfigured PostgreSQL to enable detailed connection logging, following coach suggestions. A test
                    case was added to validate that each client connection is now correctly logged in the database
                    logs.</p>

                <h4>3: Subnet Mask & Firewall Verification</h4>
                <p>We corrected the subnet mask configuration across our servers and verified open ports using
                    firewall-cmd. Screenshots were retaken on the actual VMs instead of Packet Tracer to ensure
                    authenticity and accuracy.</p>

                        <p>Apache was installed and configured to start automatically on reboot, ensuring the web server
                            runs continuously.</p>

                    <h4>2: Firewall Configuration</h4>
                    <p>Port 80 was opened in the firewall to allow external access to the web server via HTTP.</p>

                    <h4>3: Basic Website Deployment</h4>
                    <p>An index.html file and a team picture were added to the default DocumentRoot at <code>/var/www/html</code>.

                    <h4>4: File & Folder Permissions</h4>
                    <p>Files were set to <code>rw-r--r--</code> and folders to <code>rwxr-xr-x</code> with ownership
                        <code>root:apache</code>.</p>

                    <h4>5: Folder Structure & Naming</h4>
                    <p>Organized content into subfolders: <code>html</code>, <code>img</code>, <code>css</code>, <code>js</code>,
                        and <code>media</code> using lowercase, ASCII-only filenames without spaces.</p>

                    <h4>6: UTF-8 Encoding</h4>
                    <p>All webpage files are UTF-8 encoded to ensure proper character rendering across different
                        systems.</p>
